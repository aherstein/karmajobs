	<h2>Everyone else is doing it!</h2>

	<p>You might have noticed there are no ads on KarmaJobs. Well, there's a reason for that. We’re just not very fond of the idea of cramming ads down our user's throats.</p>

	<p>The KarmaJobs team offers our users a valuable community job service--for FREE. We do plan to offer more powerful tools for a small fee, but that will be your choice. We’re
		betting you’ll find them worthwhile. In the meantime, if you find KarmaJobs to be a useful service, consider buying us a cup of coffee through a small donation. And if it
		has helped you find work, maybe even a beer! We'd love nothing more than to offer our entire product feature list as soon as possible and having access to more funding will
		speed up development. That means helping more people find better jobs. And that’s pretty awesome!</p>

	<p>Thanks for being such a great community! The KarmaJobs team is looking forward to bringing you the very best community job search tools. </p>

	<p>If you'd like to support us, why not donate? We'll even take some crypto currency if you've got some to spare!</p>
